world worth

A groundbreaking, action-packed, and ultimately uplifting adventure that intertwines elements of Jewish mythology with an unflinching examination of the impacts of transphobia, from Newbery Honor-winner Kyle Lukoff

“Kyle Lukoff has given us something rare and beautiful — a novel that combines wondrous fantasy, searing real-world relevance, and a frank empathetic understanding of the adolescent experience that hits so viscerally I can only compare it to the way my generation experienced Judy Blume. The way Lukoff combines these elements in a page-turning adventure is nothing short of magic!” –Rick Riordan, author of Percy Jackson and the Olympians


Covid lockdown is over, but A’s world feels smaller than ever. Coming out as trans didn’t exactly go well, and most days, he barely leaves his bedroom, let alone the house. But the low point of A’s life isn’t online school, missing his bar mitzvah, or the fact that his parents monitor his phone like hawks—it’s the weekly Save Our Sons and Daughters meetings his parents all but drag him to.

At SOSAD, A and his friends Sal and Yarrow sit by while their parents deadname them and wring their hands over a nonexistent “transgender craze.” After all, sitting in suffocating silence has to be better than getting sent away for “advanced treatment,” never to be heard from again.

When Yarrow vanishes after a particularly confrontational meeting, A discovers that SOSAD doesn’t just feel soul-sucking . . . it’s run by an actual demon who feeds off the pain and misery of kids like him. And it’s not just SOSAD—the entire world is beset by demons dining on what seems like an endless buffet of pain and bigotry.

But how is one trans kid who hasn’t even chosen a name supposed to save his friend, let alone the world? And is a world that seems hellbent on rejecting him even worth saving at all?

a wolf called Fire

The stand-alone companion to Rosanne Parry’s New York Times bestseller A Wolf Called Wander tells the wilderness survival story of the wolf pup known as Warm and is illustrated in black and white throughout. This Voice of the Wilderness Novel features extensive back matter, including a map.

Warm is the smallest pup, the one his father calls the heart of the pack. But all Warm sees is his bigger brothers Sharp and Swift, even his sisters Pounce and Wag, winning all the wrestling matches. Just as Warm is finding his place, enemy wolves destroy and scatter the pack. Warm helps lead the pups away from the fight, only to find himself alone with four pups to defend and feed. Can he be both the heart and the head of a new pack? Does he have to choose the aggressive leadership style of his father and brothers? Or is there another way?

A Wolf Called Fire is a stand-alone companion novel to A Wolf Called Wander . It’s inspired by Wolf 8, a real Yellowstone wolf who was the smallest of his pack and constantly bullied by his bigger brothers. Wolf 8 survived a tumultuous first year and grew up to be a different sort of leader—one who fought many rival wolves to submission but never killed any. He had a rare talent for mentoring young wolves and became the patriarch of the largest and most successful pack in Yellowstone by choosing a more collaborative and generous leadership style. Features black-and-white illustrations throughout and extensive back matter, including a map.

 bakery_dragon:-
 The heroic tale of a tiny dragon with a heart of gold and a taste for baked treats! A scrumptious picture book for fans of funny fairytales and fantastic beasts.

Ember has always been different from the other dragons. His fearsome roar sounds more like a polite sneeze, and when he breathes fire, the villagers just pat his head and say awwww.

Ember fears he’ll never collect a respectable hoard of gold until a chance encounter with a baker causes his fortunes to turn (and his stomach to grumble). As the little dragon soon discovers, the gold you make is way better than the gold you steal—and gold that is shared? That’s best of all.

Magic shimmers on every page of author-illustrator Devin Elle Kurtz's feel-good story that celebrates baked goods, dragons, and generosity in equal measure. Filled with adorable illustrations, this is a perfect read aloud for bedtime or brunchtime!

two together:-

In this companion book to They All Saw a Cat and Inside Cat , a journey home leads to unexpected adventures for a cat and dog. A playful, imaginative story of friendship, empathy, and discovery by Caldecott Honor winner Brendan Wenzel.

Cat and Dog are headed home. A simple route lies ahead of them . . . or does it? There’s so much to see and smell and hear, and the two of them experience the world very differently. A stream, for instance, is watery fun for Dog, but it may not be so delightful for Cat!

As their journey becomes an adventure full of unexpected twists and turns, Cat and Dog show that it’s possible for two creatures to travel in the world together despite their distinctive perspectives and abilities—and even to appreciate and enjoy them. With the irresistible read-aloud appeal of Brendan Wenzel’s They All Saw a Cat , winner of the Caldecott Honor , this is a funny, exuberant companion tale that’s an imaginative tribute to empathy, friendship, and understanding.
 

RESPECTING Cat and Dog experience life in almost opposite ways. Through their eyes, children will see how the same situation or problem can be handled differently depending on the perspective and ability of the creature living through it, building their empathy and understanding.

DELIGHTFUL This picture book is full of visual surprises and Easter eggs, and readers will love turning back to find details that hint at developments to come on the journey. The dog's and cat’s art styles evolve throughout, becoming more developed and exaggerated but ending with a unified style that incorporates both their points of view as their friendship is affirmed and strengthened.

ENCOURAGES The path home is both a familiar route and a new experience as Cat and Dog make surprising—sometimes unpleasant—discoveries along the way. The subtle message about appreciating the small moments in everyday routines and the possibilities that await when we step outside them is perfect for young readers.

BELOVED AUTHOR/ Brendan Wenzel is a bestselling author, Caldecott Honor–winning artist, and sought-after speaker at schools and libraries. His books  They All Saw a Cat , Hello Hello , A Stone Sat Still ,  and Inside Cat have received multiple awards and starred reviews and are family and classroom favorites.

FUN READ-ALOUD Rhythmic text coupled with compelling artwork and a comforting ending make this perfect for story time, bedtime, or both!
